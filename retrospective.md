# 1.  How did your team divide the work?
The team decided to make **Jovito** fork the starter repo. Aside from developing a feature, he was also responsible to approve the [pull requests](https://github.com/jovi-isorena/pseudo-shop/pulls) and resolve merge conflicts. Then the team members negotiated for the distribution of tasks. **Cade** handled task #1 & #2. **Joshua** got the task #3 and creation of this markdown document. **Jovito** worked on task #4. When all the developers finished their tasks, a meeting was organized for a code review session and branch merging. This allows the developers to have discussions when a merge conflict occurs.
# 2.  What Git commands or workflows were most useful to you?
- *`git fetch`*
Allows the developers to get the new history version with the latest commits from the remote repo.
- *`git add .`*
Stage all changes before making a commit. Staging allows the developers to choose which changes should be committed. Ideally, a commit should only contain one logical, self-contained unit of work
- *`git commit -m ""`*
Saves the staged changes to the branch with descriptive commit message. Commit messages are important to provide context of the commit when viewed in the *history log*.
- *`git push`*
Pushes committed changes in the feature branches to remote repository.
-*`git checkout`*
Developers can switch between different branches.
- *`git merge`*
Merges feature branches to the main branch.
- *`git branch`*
Allows developers to create feature branches.
- *`git pull`*
Fetches new history version from the remote repository. Developers can update their local repository.
# 3.  Describe the merge conflict your team encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
Our team encountered multiple merge conflicts. All of them are caused by two or more developers editing the same files. To resolve them, we discuss the conflicts in a meeting. In some conflicts, we determined to combine the changes from different branches. In some conflicts, we choose to implement the most recent change or the improved version. We used the GitHub merging tool via pull requests.
# 4.  What were the biggest challenges during this activity?
- Prioritization of tasks.
- Formulation of the pseudocode based on the ticket.
- Formulation of commit messages and branch names while following standards.
- Overlapping requirements in the ticket.
- Resolving merge conflicts.
# 5.  What did you learn about using Git in a team setting?
We learned that constant communication is important when using Git in a team setting. Every developer should know the current state of the project as they need to make important decisions in the lifecycle of the software, such as prioritizing tasks and assigning them to appropriate developer. Constant monitoring is also essential as it give insight on the direction the project is heading to. Leaders also need to know if there are any blockers that hinders the progress of a developer so that they can help to eliminate the said blockers. Git is an excellent collaboration tool, but the team should implement their own strategies to achieve their goals seamlessly.  
# 6.  How would you improve your workflow in future projects?
For future project, we would like to use a kanban board to organize and manage tickets. This productivity tool can allow us to view all tickets and relevant information, like assigned developer and priority level. By allowing all developers to monitor all the tickets, it can boost the productivity of the team by allowing developers to create decisions with information available on the board.
# 7. Any feedback on the activity?
The project guide for the features are a bit ambiguous.
